 Describes Signly lInked Lists

 A Singly Linked List is the most common form of a Linked List where each node contains a data field and a single pointer to the next node in the list.

Singly Linked List Java

The reference to the first node in the list is called the HEAD of the list. The pointer/reference/link field contained in the node is used to traverse to the next node and to its next node and so on till we reach a node that points to NULL. This is the last node in the list.  Also, a singly linked list can only be traversed in one and only one direction i.e. from head to the last node. There is no way to traverse from the last node back to the head. The following is an example of a singly linked list with 5 nodes.
