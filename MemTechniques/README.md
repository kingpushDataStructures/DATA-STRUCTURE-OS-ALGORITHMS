# MemTechniques
 Describes the Various Memory Management Techniques

 Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.

 #Run main method and select various ooptions to run algorithm
 #Contains the following various algorithms
